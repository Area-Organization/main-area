# Features

### Flow Editor (Drag & Drop)

Unlike a traditional form-based approach, the `/create` page implements a full visual editor:

- **Infinite Canvas**: Based on Svelte Flow, the user is provided with a workspace.
- **Sidebar**: Lists available services (Actions on the left, Reactions on the right).
- **Drag & Drop**: The user drags (`@thisux/sveltednd`) an Action and a Reaction onto the canvas.
- **Node Configuration**:
  - Nodes (`ActionNode.svelte`, `ReactionNode.svelte`) are interactive.
  - They display form fields for the required parameters.
  - They validate data in real time.
- **Linking**: The user visually connects the Action node to the Reaction node to validate the flow.
- **Variables**: When an Action is connected, the Reaction node displays available variables (`{{...}}`) to make copy-pasting easier.

### Dashboard

The dashboard displays AREAs as a grid of cards.

- Visual indicators of the state (Active/Inactive).
- Details about the last trigger.
- Ability to disable an AREA without deleting it.

### Profile & Services

The `/profile` page allows users to manage connections to third-party services.

- Displays the connection status of each service (on/off switch).
- Handles OAuth2 redirection to connect a new service.
- Uses the `ServiceCard` and `ServiceIcon` components for a unified presentation.
