# Backend Introduction

The backend is the brain of the AREA project. It orchestrates authentications, manages connections to third-party APIs, and executes automation tasks via a polling system.

## Key Technologies

- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) – Used for its performance and built-in tooling (testing, package management).
- **API Framework**: [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) – High-performance framework with full TypeScript support and validation via TypeBox.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) – Manages the database schema and migrations.
- **Authentication**: [Better Auth](https://better-auth.dev/) – Handles local authentication (Email/Password) and OAuth2, with persistence via Prisma Adapter.
- **API Documentation**: `@elysiajs/openapi` plugin to generate Swagger-compliant documentation.
- **Testing**: `bun:test` for unit and integration tests.

## Main Responsibilities

1. **API Gateway**: Exposes routes for Web and Mobile clients via `src/app.ts`.
2. **Service Registry**: Centralizes integration logic (GitHub, Gmail, Spotify, Trello, Discord).
3. **Automation Engine (HookManager)**: A background process that periodically checks if user actions are triggered.
4. **Connection Management**: Stores and refreshes access tokens (OAuth2) or API keys for third-party services.
5. **Data Interpolation**: Allows passing dynamic data from an Action to a Reaction (e.g., `{{authorName}}` in a Discord message).
