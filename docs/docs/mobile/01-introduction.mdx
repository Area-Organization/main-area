# Mobile Client Introduction

The mobile application allows users to create and manage their AREA automations from a smartphone. It focuses on a smooth and animated user experience.

## Key Technologies

- **Framework**: React Native 0.81 (via **Expo SDK 54**).
- **Language**: TypeScript.
- **UI Library**: **React 19** (using the latest React features).
- **Styling**: **NativeWind** (TailwindCSS for React Native).
- **Animations**: **React Native Reanimated 4** for complex interactions (drag, swipe, wizard).
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing).
- **API Client**: `@elysiajs/eden` (type-safe client generated from the backend).
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (React client + Expo plugin + SecureStore).

## Dynamic Configuration

To simplify development and testing on physical devices, the application includes a `UrlConfigModal` component. It allows changing the backend API URL on the fly (stored in `AsyncStorage`), avoiding the need to rebuild the application when switching environments (localhost vs local IP).
