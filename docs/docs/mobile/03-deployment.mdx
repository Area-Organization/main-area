# Android Build and Distribution

The project uses **EAS Build** (Expo Application Services) to generate native binaries (APK/AAB).

## Docker Strategy

The `Dockerfile` located in `apps/mobile` is not used to run the mobile application (since React Native runs on the end user’s device), but to **serve the generated APK**.

The container uses a lightweight image (Alpine Linux) to copy the pre-built APK (`client.apk`) to a shared volume, making it accessible (for example via a web server like Nginx, or for direct download in a CI/CD pipeline).

```dockerfile
# Mobile Dockerfile snippet
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY client.apk /app/client.apk
# Copy to the shared volume at startup
CMD cp /app/client.apk /dist/client.apk && tail -f /dev/null
```

## Generate the APK

To generate the APK locally (without using Expo’s Cloud build queue), the following command is configured:

```bash
bun run build:preview
```

This command internally runs:
`eas build --local --profile preview --platform android`

The resulting APK can then be renamed to client.apk to be used by the Dockerfile.
