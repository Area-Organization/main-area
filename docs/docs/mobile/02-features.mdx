# Features and Interface

### Creation Flow (Wizard)

Creating an AREA is done through an immersive, step-by-step wizard (`app/(tabs)/create.tsx`):

1. **Trigger Selection**: Grid of available services.
2. **Configuration**: Dynamic form (`ParamInputs.tsx`) based on the required parameter types (text, number, boolean).
3. **Reaction Selection**: Same process as for the trigger.
4. **Connection (Review)**:
   - An SVG animation (`react-native-svg` + `reanimated`) visualizes the connection between the two services (a pulsing cable).
   - The user names their AREA and confirms.
   - A “Confetti” animation confirms successful creation.

### Interactive Dashboard

The home screen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`) displays AREAs as cards:

- **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe a card to the right to edit, to the left to delete.
- **Toggle Switch**: A custom animated switch allows instantly enabling/disabling an AREA.
- **Statistics**: “Glassmorphism” cards display global stats at the top of the page.

### Service Management

The Services screen (`app/(tabs)/services.tsx`) handles two types of authentication:

1. **OAuth2**: Opens a `WebBrowser` session. The callback redirects back to the app (`area://oauth-callback`), which validates the token with the backend.
2. **API Key**: Opens a modal to manually enter keys (e.g. Discord token, Trello key).

### Offline Management

An `OfflineNotice` component monitors network status (`expo-network`) and displays an animated banner if the internet connection is lost.
